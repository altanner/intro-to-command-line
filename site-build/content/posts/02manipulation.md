{{< admonition type="success" title="Learn more" open=false >}}
We give some warnings on this page, but don't be intimidated! Mistakes are only human, and you won't be able to damage your computer through any of these commands.

To improve your skills in backing up, version control, and minimising risk in computing, look for our courses on *Best Practices in Software Engineering*.
{{< /admonition >}}

{{< admonition type="info" title="Course materials" open=true >}}
From this point forward, you will need to [download the course materials](https://github.com/alleetanner/intro-to-command-line/raw/master/command-line-files.zip); move this to a suitable folder, and unzip it.
- If you are using GitBash on Windows, copy and run this command
```
git clone https://github.com/alleetanner/intro-to-command-line.git
```
{{< /admonition >}}

In our terminal, use the command line to move into the course materials folder, `command-line-files`. When you run `ls` in this folder, you should see the list of contents looking like
```
example_files     sandpit    some_plays
```
Personally, I don't find that clear to look at, so let's use our first *flag*, running `ls -l`.

{{< admonition type="question" title="Questions" open=true >}}
- What do you think the `-l` is short for?
- What extra information are you given?
- Try some more flags and work out what they do: `-s`, `-t`, `-r`
- And some flag combinations: `-ls`, `-lrt`
{{< /admonition >}}

{{< admonition type="info" open=true >}}
- Flags are also known as "options" - you will have to get used to this!
- Flags start with a `-`, a dash.
- Spoken, the command `ls -l` might be said "L S dash L"... but sometimes people say "minus", or "hyphen" instead of "dash". These all mean the same thing: the key to the left of the `=+` key.

### Copying
Let's move into the folder called `sandpit` and play with some files. Firstly, let's copy a file:
```
cp data1 data3
```
Here we are saying "copy the file called data1 to a new file called data3". We now have two identical copies of the same file, only different by name.

{{< admonition type="warning" open=true >}}
- The command line will overwrite files with **no warning!** If, for example, `data3` already exists, the command `cp data1 data3` would overwrite `data3` with the contents of `data1` - permanently deleting the contents of `data3`!
- With great power comes great responsibility! :)
{{< /admonition >}}

### Deleting
Now let's try to delete, or "remove", the file we just made:
```
rm data3
```
Here we said "remove the file called data3".
{{< admonition type="warning" open=true >}}
- `rm`, "remove" is the same as delete. But **without a recycle bin, undo, back button, or any other safety-nets.**
- `rm`, `cp` and `mv` commands all have the potential to cause permanent data loss!
{{< /admonition >}}
Now let's try copying, moving and removing folders. There are some folders in the sandpit to play with. Have a go at using `cp` and `rm` on there, and notice what it will and will not let you do. For folders that are not empty, we will need to use another *flag*:
```
cp -r folder_with_files_inside folder_copy
```
Here we asked the computer to "copy, recursively, this folder to that folder". Empty folders can be copied, moved and removed, but you will need to use `-r` if there are items insides. `-r` is a common flag which we will use again later.

{{< admonition type="info" open=true >}}
Not all flags mean the same, when applied to other commands! `-r` does the same thing for `cp` and `mv` and `rm`, but don't assume it does the same thing for all commands!
{{< /admonition >}}

Try moving into the folder with files inside.

{{< admonition type="question" open=true >}}
Can you `cp` a file to the folder *containing* the one you are in?
{{< /admonition >}}

### Moving
Finally, let's look at moving files.
```
mv data1 data4
```
Which means, "move the file called to data1 to a file called data4". Move is essentially "rename" (although it is doing exactly the same as moving items in your graphical interface).

{{< admonition type="warning" open=true >}}
- As such, if `data4` already existed, it would be *deleted* by the command `mv data1 data4`! Be very careful with `mv`!
- OK, that is my last warning for now :)
{{< /admonition >}}

### Exercise
Have a play in the sandpit, using `cd`, `ls`, `mkdir` and the file manipulation commands `cp`, `rm` and `mv`.
{{< admonition type="question" title="Exercise" open=true >}}
- Can you `mv` one file to more than one destination?
- What happens if you give `cp` no destination?
- Can you `cp`, but without being inside the folder it is located in?
- Can you move a folder?
- How does moving a *file* onto a *folder* behave?
- Can you `mv` the folder you are actually in?
