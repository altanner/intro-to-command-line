I am a Research Software Engineer at the University of Bristol, UK. I support research groups in their coding and computation, I advocate clearly written, sensible software, and I teach these skills in my university community. My experience includes an MSci in Evolution & Palaeontology, leading to a doctoral scholarship in teaching and research (UoB STaR 2013-2018). I gained my PhD in Phylogenomics is 2018, and since then I have broadened my skills in data science and computation as a member of the RSE team.

My software engineering projects have included molecular evolution, epidemiology, physics, and spectroscopy. I enjoy being a scientific generalist, and I have collaborative experience across four schools (Earth Sciences, Life Sciences, Physics and the Medical School) at the University of Bristol.
